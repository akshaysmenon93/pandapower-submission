## Please not that I have used the blog slug as the url param while routing from the blog listing page to the
individual blog page. This has been done to comply with SEO friendly urls. 

## The current problem with this approach is that, if you directly try to access the blogpost with th url
'localhost:3000/blogs/blog-post-1' it will return an error. This error has been handled by an error boundary. The error
screen produced by react will not be shown in a production build. 

## To be able to display the blog by directly accessing the url, necessary changes have to be made to fetch a 
blog by its slug using an API.
